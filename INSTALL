QUICK INSTALLATION GUIDE

CONTENTS
 1) FROM COMPRESSED ARCHIVE
 2) FROM SVN
 3) INVOKING callirhoe FROM PATH
 4) INSTALLATION FOR ARCH LINUX

(rough installation guide for novice users...)

1) FROM COMPRESSED ARCHIVE

Download the latest version from the project's page,
or directly from:
    https://callirhoe.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/releases/

You end up with a file named callirhoe-X.Y.Z.7z where X.Y.Z the version number (for example 0.4.0).

Extract the contents of the archive
$ 7z x callirhoe-X.Y.Z.7z

Change into program's directory
$ cd callirhoe-X.Y.Z

Now you can launch the program, e.g.

$ ./callirhoe.py foo.pdf

See section 3 for how to install callirhoe so that it lies in your executable path.

2) FROM SVN

Checkout the latest version from the svn:

$ svn checkout https://callirhoe.googlecode.com/svn/trunk callirhoe-svn

Change into directory

$ cd callirhoe-svn

After a few days/weeks/months... you may update to the latest version:

$ svn up

You can launch the program as usual:

$ ./callirhoe.py foo.pdf

3) INVOKING callirhoe FROM PATH

You can add a link to your path, $HOME/bin or /usr/local/bin:

$ ln -s `pwd`/callirhoe.py $HOME/bin/callirhoe

You can do the same with calmagick.py. You may also install it system-wide,
for example in /opt. In this case, keep in mind, that ~/.callirhoe/ is also
searched for additional definitions, styles etc.

If you do not plan to mess with the source, you may create a binary python package.
This is not exactly a binary, it is a zip archive containing compiled python bytecode,
which is quite compact. To do so, go to the scripts directory:

$ cd scripts

and run

$ ./make_pkg

This will create in the parent directory two executables, 'callirhoe' and 'calmagick'.
Now copy them to your binary path. And you can remove the source dir, as it is no longer
needed. You might want to copy the holiday data files first, if you want to use them
(callirhoe takes a full path to them, so you can store them wherever you want).

On a linux system, you will additionally see a Makefile created, which you can alternatively
run with 'make install' to install the files in the standard places, 
instead of manually copying them.

4) INSTALLATION FOR ARCH LINUX

There is a PKGBUILD file you can use to install.
You can get the PKGBUILD either from SVN or compressed archive or from AUR.
For the first two options, the method to get the source tree is described in sections 1 and 2,
while for the third option you can get it from here: <INSERT LINK HERE>


Place the PKGBUILD into a directory and run:

$ makepkg -si

( -s will automatically install missing depedencies )

Arch will do the rest for you.

In the unlikely event that you don't have "makepkg" already installed
you can find information about it's installation here:
