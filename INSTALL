QUICK INSTALLATION GUIDE

(rough installation guide for novice users...)

1) FROM COMPRESSED ARCHIVE

Download the latest version form
    http://code.google.com/p/callirhoe/wiki/Releases
    
You end up with a file named callirhoe-X.Y.Z.7z where X.Y.Z the version number (for example 0.3.0). 

Extract the contents of the archive
$ 7z x callirhoe-X.Y.Z.7z

Change into program's directory
$ cd callirhoe-X.Y.Z

Now you can launch the program, e.g.

$ ./callirhoe.py foo.pdf

You may want to add a link to your path, $HOME/bin or /usr/local/bin:

$ ln -s `pwd`/callirhoe.py $HOME/bin/callirhoe

You can do the same with calmagick.py. You may also install it system-wide,
for example in /opt. In this case, keep in mind, that ~/.callirhoe/ is also
searched for additional definitions, styles etc.

2) FROM SVN

Checkout the latest version from the svn:

$ svn checkout https://callirhoe.googlecode.com/svn/trunk callirhoe-svn

Change into directory

$ cd callirhoe-svn

After a few days/weeks/months... you may update to the latest version:

$ svn up

You can launch the program as usual:

$ ./callirhoe.py foo.pdf
